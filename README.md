## Example calculator app

`HMR Enabled`
A basic calculator written with Javascript (ES2015), React.js, Redux, Immutable & Webpack.

It doesn't do anything special, beyond what a normal calculator does.  It's just a simple demo to show how the technologies work together.

### Development

To try this out, run `npm install`.  Then browse to `localhost:8080` in your browser.
